# Virtual Function
A virtual function (also known as virtual methods) is a member function that is declared within a base class and is re-defined (overridden) by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the method.

- Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for the function call.
- They are mainly used to achieve Runtime polymorphism.
- Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in a base class.
- The resolving of a function call is done at runtime.


# Rules for Virtual Functions
The rules for the virtual functions in C++ are as follows:

- Virtual functions cannot be static.
- A virtual function can be a friend function of another class.
- Virtual functions should be accessed using a pointer or reference of base class type to       achieve runtime polymorphism.
- The prototype of virtual functions should be the same in the base as well as the derived class.
- They are always defined in the base class and overridden in a derived class. It is not mandatory for the derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case, the base class version of the function is used.
- A class may have a virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.
