# Polymorphism
The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A person at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. An operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances. The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation. C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.

# Compile-Time Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
> Note: we explaind function overloading previusly


# Runtime Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved by Function Overriding. Late binding and dynamic polymorphism are other names for runtime polymorphism. The function call is resolved at runtime in runtime polymorphism. In contrast, with compile time polymorphism, the compiler determines which function call to bind to the object after deducing it at runtime.
