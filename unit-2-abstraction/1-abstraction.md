# Abstraction
Data abstraction is one of the most essential and important features of object-oriented programming in C++. Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation. 

# Types of Abstraction:
- ### Data abstraction
    This type only shows the required information about the data and hides the unnecessary data.
- #### Control Abstraction
    This type only shows the required information about the implementation and hides unnecessary information.



# Abstraction using Access Specifiers (Data Hiding)
Access specifiers are the main pillar of implementing abstraction in C++. We can use access specifiers to enforce restrictions on class members. For example:

- ### Public
    Members can be accessed inside and outisde the class
- ### Private
    Members can be accessed inside the class only

> Note: there is another spacifier 'protedted' will explained in inhiratance.


# Abstraction in Header files
One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files where we can separate what frm how.
