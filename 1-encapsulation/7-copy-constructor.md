# Copy Constructors (4 cases)
A copy constructor is a member function that initializes an object using another object of the same class. In simple terms, a constructor which creates an object by initializing it with an object of the same class, which has been created previously is known as a copy constructor.  

Copy constructor is used to initialize the members of a newly created object by copying the members of an already existing object.

Copy constructor takes a reference to an object of the same class as an argument.

A Copy Constructor creates a new object, which is an exact copy of the existing object. The compiler provides a default Copy Constructor to all the classes.

### Syntax:
```
class-name (class-name &){}
```

# Copy Constructor 
# Temporary Object
